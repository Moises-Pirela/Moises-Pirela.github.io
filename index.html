                <p> As a dedicated software craftsman, I have carved out my career within the exhilarating
                    realm of the gaming industry. My expertise spans various domains, including Mobile Applications,
                    Game Programming, AWS, C# C/C++.</p>

                <p>My journey in the gaming universe has been a thrilling one, filled with opportunities to hone my
                    skills and lead exciting projects. Currently, I'm at the helm of a dynamic team of six developers at
                    <a href="https://alwaysimagine.com/">Always Imagine</a>, steering the ship for the creation of the
                    epic
                    adventure known as Mythic Legions Tactics.
                    You can check it out <a
                        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710950/Mythic_Legions_Tactics/">here</a>.My
                    role involves architecting the project, ensuring tasks are well-defined and deadlines are met,
                    and
                    overseeing the development of core gameplay systems.
                </p>

                <p>Before my current adventure, I had the privilege of working as a Senior Gameplay Engineer at
                    Backoffice Abroad, contributing my technical prowess to <a
                        href="https://www.perfectstorm.gg/">Perfect Storm Studios</a>. I played a pivotal
                    role in crafting a Map Editor for our talented designers and an Editor for various gameplay
                    configurations, all while working with a custom ECS framework to implement engaging gameplay
                    systems.</p>

                <p>During my journey, I've also worn the hat of a Freelance Game Developer, where I honed my skills and
                    tackled various exciting projects. My passion for game development has led me on an enriching path,
                    which started at <a href="https://gstationstudio.com/">Games Station.</a></p>

                <p>My dedication to the world of gaming, along with my technical expertise, makes me a firm believer
                    that innovation and captivating experiences can be created through code. If you're looking for a
                    professional who combines a strong engineering background with a profound passion for gaming, I'd be
                    thrilled to connect and explore potential opportunities together.</p>
